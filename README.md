## Local environment

In order to run the Integration tests a Postgres database is required.

In order to run this service locally, an ActiveMQ service is required. 

Create Postgres database and ActiveMQ service with docker-compose:
 
```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will install and setup Postgres database with correct database name, username and password,
likewise for ActiveMQ.
